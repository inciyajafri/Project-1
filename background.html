	<h3><i> A little background information about me and some fun facts! </i></h3>
	<p> Hi! My name is (In-see-ya) and I was born in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. My parents are from Pakistan, but I was
		born and raised in the US. I'm not sure if any of you will be familiar with the city, but I grew up in South Barrington, IL. 
		I attended Barrington High School from 2011-2015 and then attended Indiana University-Bloomington with a major in computer
		science. I decided that was not what I wanted to do since I found it somewhat boring, so I decided to transfer to Harper 
		College to get my Gen Eds out of the way. After finishing 2 years, I decided to major in Information Technology and 
		Management and I could not be more happy! I chose IIT because I have always wanted to live in the city and I was not a huge
		fan living on a huge college campus. I am a second year student since some of the credits at Harper were not able to 
		transfer. I enjoy interacting with people and I absolutely love traveling because I am able to learn about a wide variety of 
		different cultures. Not only that, I love to help out as much as I am able to in the community. If you navigate to my 
		resume page you will be able to see some of the places I volunteer for. My favorite color is blue and my favorite shows 
		include: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> The Office </li>
		<li> Black Mirror </li>
		<li> Orphan Black </li> 
		<li> How I Met Your Mother </li> 
  </ul>
