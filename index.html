	<p>This page includes a brief overview about my life and some of the things I have accomplished throughout it! This picture 
	is a picture of my little sister and I. I am so excited to learn more about html and the design aspect with CSS. This class has already taught me a lot 
	and I cannot wait to add to that list. I hope everyone has a fantastic semester! Here are a few links to help you all 
	get to know me a bit more! </p>
